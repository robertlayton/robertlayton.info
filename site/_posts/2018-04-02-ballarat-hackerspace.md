The Ballarat Hackerspace is a non-profit community organisation created to help introduce future technology to Ballarat.
Additionally, the hackerspace provides a workshop where members can come and build their projects in a friendly, collaborative and engaging environment.
Members of the Ballarat Hackerspace have created lots of great projects, bouncing ideas off each other and helping each other.

The Ballarat Hackerspace is a supportive environment with a clear code of conduct and supports all people using the space.
Initiatives on this front include the ability for members to bring in their kids under their membership (although the guardiant is responsible for them), and Women's Wednesdays, where women can use the space for free, for ever.

The Ballarat Hackerspace has become a central nexus for technology activity in Ballarat, working with local Universities, schools, organisations, community leaders and businesses.
It is funded through memberships and sponsorships, and has been running for over three years.
